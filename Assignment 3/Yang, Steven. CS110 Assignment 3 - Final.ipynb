    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-completion functionalities are now ubiquitous in search engines, document editors, and messaging apps. How would you go about developing an algorithmic strategy from scratch to implement these computational solutions? In this assignment, you will learn about a new data structure and use it to build a very simple auto-complete engine. Each question in the assignment guides you closer to that objective while encouraging you to contrast this novel data structure to the other ones we have discussed in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [trie tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie), or a prefix tree, is a common data structure that stores a set of strings in a collection of nodes so that all strings with a common prefix are found in the same branch of the tree. Each node is associated with a letter, and as you traverse down the tree, you pick up more letters, eventually forming a word. Complete words are commonly found on the leaf nodes. However, some inner nodes can also mark full words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use an example diagram to illustrate several important features of tries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nodes that mark valid words are marked in yellow. Notice that while all leaves are considered valid words, only some inner nodes contain valid words, while some remain only prefixes to valid words appearing down the branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tree does not have to be balanced, and the height of different branches depends on its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In our implementation, branches never merge to show common suffixes (for example, both ANT and ART end in T, but these nodes are kept separate in their respective branches). However, this is a common first line of memory optimization for tries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first node contains an empty string; it “holds the tree together.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task in this assignment will be to implement a functional trie tree. You will be able to insert words into a dictionary, lookup valid and invalid words, print your dictionary in alphabetical order, and suggest appropriate suffixes like an auto-complete bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment questions will guide you through these tasks one by one. To stay safe from breaking your own code, and to reinforce the idea of code versioning, under each new question first **copy your previous (working) code**, and only then **implement the new feature**. The code skeletons provided throughout will make this easier for you at the cost of repeating some large portions of code."

    "\n",

Which method do you think is a better fit for trie trees, and why? **Justify your reasoning in around 100 words.** You will use your chosen approach throughout the assignment, so don't rush this question."

    "It is a better idea to separate the problem into two classes. One needs to understand that if nodes and trees as a whole are handled at once, the following problems can occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code architecture way is more confusing because it is not intuitive and clear enough for a person to read. #CodeReadabilty\n",
    "2. When one debugs, it is more time-consuming as the size of the problem is bigger. (i.e. Just debugging node part vs. debugging the whole problem.)\n",

    "These two reasons are practical reasons that one needs to consider dividing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other analytical reasons are following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a node class separately allows specializing managing the nodes only. This means when one calls the methods in trees, one can protect the nodes from getting updated accidentally because of unexpected methods. Another reason for having a node class separately is it allows to pass down the data(characters) node to node more effectively -- it does not depend on how tree methods work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a trie class separately also makes the problem much simpler as it only deals with the tree structure but not the data themselves. As the data part is already controlled in the class node, the trie class can only have tree structures and make it simpler."

    "In the two cells below, there are two code skeletons. Depending on your answer to Q1a, either **implement a Node and a Trie class** or **implement a Node class**. Choose the corresponding code cell and delete the other one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your class(es), write **insert()** and **lookup()** methods, which will insert a word into the trie tree and look it up, respectively. Use the code skeleton and examine the specifications of its docstrings to guide you on the details of inputs and outputs to each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are coding two classes, your Trie should, upon initiation, create the root Node. If you are coding a single class, use an attribute to mark the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, make sure that the trie can be **initiated with a wordbank as an input**. This means that a user can create a trie and feed it an initial dictionary of words at the same time (like in the tests below), which will be automatically inserted into the trie upon its creation. Likely, this will mean that your \\_\\_init\\_\\_() has to make some calls to your insert() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several test cases have been provided for your convenience and these include some, but not all, possible edge cases. If the implementation is correct, your code will pass all the tests. In addition, create at least **three more tests** to demonstrate that your code is working correctly and justify why such test cases are appropriate."

The height of the BST should be much greater than the height of the tries beecause BST can only has two children while tries can have multiple children. In other words, the height of the trie is the same as the length of the longest word (l) in the word bank while BST is something that is greater than that — which can be greater than the longest length of the wrod from the wordbank (n). This is why O(l) < O(n).\n",

This means that n will not be huge enough in most cases that'd affect the algorithmic behavior dramatically. Given this understanding, as English language does NOT include such a long word like 100 characters, it is okay to use trie trees for dictionary."

    "To mathematically determine the overall connotation of a speech, you might want to compute which words are most frequently used and then run a [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis). To this end, add a method to your code, **k_most_common()** that will take as an input k, an integer, and return a list of the k most common words from the dictionary within the trie. The structure of the output list should be such that each entry is a tuple, the first element being the word and the second an integer of its frequency (see docstring if you’re confused).\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this exercise, you don’t have to bother with resolving ties (for example, if k = 1, but there are two most common words with the same frequency, you can return either of them), but consider it an extra challenge and let us know if you believe you managed to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test cell below downloads and preprocesses several real-world speeches, and then runs the k-most-common word analysis of them; your code should pass the tests. As usual, add at least **three more tests**, and justify why they are relevant to your code (feel free to find more speeches to start analysing too!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, copy-paste your previous code and make adjustments to this \"new version\". The first cell has been locked to stop you from accidentally deleting the docstrings.\n",

    "Completing this question well will help you to tackle Q5!\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Hint: This task will probably require your nodes to store more information about the frequency of words inserted into the tree. One data structure that might be very useful to tackle the problem of traversing the tree and finding most common words is heaps — you are allowed to use the heapq library or another alternative for this task.)*"

    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a new **autocomplete()** method for your class, which will take a string as an input, and return another string as an output. If the string is not present in the tree, the output will be the same as the input. However, if the string is present in the tree, your task is to find the most common word to which it is a prefix and return that word instead (this can still turn out to be itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the task more interesting, use the test cell code to download and parse “The Complete Works of William Shakespeare”, and insert them into a trie. Your autocomplete should then pass the following tests. As usual, add at least **three more test cases**, and explain why they are appropriate (you can use input other than Shakespeare for them).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to include a minimum **100 word-summary critically evaluating** your autocomplete engine. How does it really work? Your critical reflection needs to specifically evaluate the role of the different data structures used by their algorithm and what is the overall complexity that the algorithm offers. Can we do better? If so, how and by how much?\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Hint: Again, depending on how you choose to implement it, your autocomplete() might make calls to other helper methods. However, make sure that autocomplete() is the method exposed to the user in order to pass the tests.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is a thoroughly frequentist approach to the problem, which is not the only method, and in many cases not the ideal method. However, if you were tasked with implementing something like [this](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/) or [this](https://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/autocomplete/), it might just be enough, so let’s give it a go. Good luck!*"

In reality, having a dictionary that includes only or less than ten words is meaningless because one would rather memorize the whole ten words rather than make this massive effort to make a dictionary. Assume that we will have more than ten words in the dictionary; n is much smaller than n log n. Therefore, it is better to use autocomplete."

    "1. #strategize: I explained the strengths and weaknesses of having only one class and two separate classes. This strategy worked because it made the debugging process much easier and less time-consuming, which is amazing when one does the assignment. This kind of strategizing skill is significant before hard coding; because it depends on how one starts the problem and approaches. The future codes and algorithms that one should handle come with very different difficulties.\n",

    "2. #analogies: Rather than giving many details of the BST, I used this HC to address the similarities between the BST and the tries effectively. This is helpful because when a person who does not have a strong background in algorithms reads this assignment, one can easily understand some parts they should know from BST but not all. Of course, it is much more helpful for one if they know a lot of BST; however, it is also important to effectively address some points that one can understand real quick to follow the rest of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. #algorithms: I identified an appropriate algorithmic strategy, a recursive approach, as it is better to start from the middle rather than going back to the root node. I clearly commented on codes so one can easily understand every step of the code."
